      <h2>Privacy Policy for Warped Pinball</h2>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 7th 2025</p>

      <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>
        We collect the following types of information from users of the app:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Personal Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email
        address, screen name, and any other information you voluntarily provide to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Location Data:</strong> When you use the app to scan into a pinball machine, we
        collect location data. This may include rough location information based on the machine's
        physical location, and in some cases, GPS data if you are using a mobile device. We use this
        data for the purpose of tracking your gameplay and providing location-based services, but we
        do not share your location with third parties.
      </p>

      <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
      <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To track your pinball scores and gameplay.</li>
        <li>
          To provide you with app-related notifications, such as updates on products, account
          password resets, and email validation.
        </li>
        <li>To improve our services and ensure that our app is functioning properly.</li>
        <li>
          To send you marketing materials, but only if you have explicitly requested to receive
          them. You can opt-out of marketing emails at any time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
      <p>
        We respect your privacy and will not share your personal data (including email address,
        screen name, and location data) with third parties for any reason, unless required by law or
        in the event of an emergency. If we need to share data for marketing or other purposes, we
        will do so only in anonymized or aggregated form, ensuring that no personally identifiable
        information is exposed.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Data Retention</h3>
      <p>
        We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide you with the app’s
        services and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. If you decide to delete your
        account, we will make reasonable efforts to remove your data from our systems, except where
        required by law to retain certain information.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Security of Your Information</h3>
      <p>
        We take the security of your personal information seriously and implement industry-standard
        measures to protect it. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of
        electronic storage is 100% secure, and while we strive to protect your data, we cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Your Rights and Choices</h3>
      <p>You have the following rights with respect to your personal information:</p>

          personal information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can opt-out of marketing communications at any time by
          following the instructions in the emails we send you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deletion:</strong> You may request the deletion of your account and personal

      <h3>8. Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p>
        While we strive to protect your data and ensure the security of our app, accidents may
        happen, and we cannot be held liable for any loss or damage resulting from unforeseen issues,
        provided we are acting in good faith. We make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy,
