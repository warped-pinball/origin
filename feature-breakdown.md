TODO list:
- [x] write up an agents.md
- [x] seperate the app dir into api and ray 
- [x] challange common files to be put in their respective dirs
- [ ] big screen styling fixes:
    - [ ] when real time scores just started, the size is smaller than when it's populated
    - [ ] animate the transition between "player up"s (fade in and out)
    - [ ] there's too much margin around the score in the ball stats (move clock to the left?) ball stats end up "wraping around" when on narrower screens or when we get to ball 5
    - [ ] animate the transitions between leaderbaords, have them slide off the screen like a carousel. So they should slide left to right, the new ones will just slide in from the right and replace the outgoing board. Make them pause when "aligned" before continuing. 
- [ ] big screen settings: points for each ball, or graph of all scores or "simple" with just total scores
- [ ] player ELO leaderboard
- [ ] avatar builder
- [ ] email signup workflow
- [ ] QR code scanning setup
